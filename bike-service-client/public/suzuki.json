        "description":"The Suzuki GSX-R150 is a reasonably short bike with a seat height of 785mm. The bike is mainly suited for riders more than 5'4. The bike also has a short rear section with a small back seat. The tank of the bike is 11 liters. The tank will not be the best for long rides as it will not have the best range.The bike has a length, width, height, and weight of around 2000mm, 700mm, 1070mm, and 134kg. The bike is very light compared to other sports bikes, which is not very good for a sports bike as it requires weight to keep it stable at high speeds. The bike's ground clearance is 155mm, which might make it slightly prone to getting stuck on the speedbumps of Bangladesh when riding with a heavy pillion. The bike's wheelbase is around 1300mm, making it quite elegant, but it might be slightly unstable at corners."
